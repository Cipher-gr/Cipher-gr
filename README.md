## Wazup!
-My name is _**Gabriel**_, nice to meet you too!

- I'm seeking to become a Software/CyberSecurity Engineer in the future, at the moment I'm still learning to program in C/C++, DSA, CyberSec, and Network basics.

- I mean, I'm a beginner so a little water for someone lost in the desert is always welcome.
- yeah, my English grammar is not that well.

- Btw, I will try to post some projects sometimes.
