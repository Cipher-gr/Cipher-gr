## Wazup!
-My name is _**Gabriel**_, nice to meet you too!

- I'm seeking to become a Software/CyberSecurity Engineer in the future, at the moment I'm still learning to program in C/C++, DSA, CyberSec, and Network basics.

- I mean, I'm a beginner so a little water for someone lost in the desert is always welcome.
- yeah, my English grammar is not that well.
  
- ðŸ¤” Iâ€™m seeking help with entering into the TECH market (and finding some project ideas too)

- ðŸ“« How to reach me:
  - --Discord: grs11k
  - --Linkedin: /gabriel-resende-da-silva-0b738726b/

- Btw, I will try to post some projects sometimes.
