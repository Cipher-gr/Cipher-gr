## Wazup!
-My name is _**Gabriel**_, nice to meet you too!

- I'm seeking FullstackDev(emphasis on Backend) in the future, but I'm just learning programming, and practicing DSA on Beecrowd, NepsAcademy, etc...

- I also enjoy the cybersecurity area(yeah, I didn't decide which career I want btw, but if I could choose I would choose both).

- For cybersecurity, I'm learning through books and some platforms such as TryHackMe and others.

- I mean, I'm a beginner so a little water for someone lost in the desert is always welcome.

- yeah, my English is not that well.

- ðŸ¤” Iâ€™m seeking help with entering into the developer market (and finding some project ideas too)
